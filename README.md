- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fowell Whitfield - aka buthlezi

- ðŸŒ± I am a passionate and enthusiastic software developer with a background in communications/network engineering. I am keen to develop my coding skills and knowledge and very excited about the applications of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Reactjs, Nodejs, Python and Django in designing web apps. Currently, I am exploring these technologies at Codehance.com where I have been a trainee developer since April 2021.
